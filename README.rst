Running the Tests
-----------------

A suite of unit tests is available from the ``tests`` directory. You can run it
with the help of CMake.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ cd m3ta
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ ctest


To run specific tests, it is possible to pass names to match in the command
line.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ ctest -R test_my_code


This command will run all the tests containing ``test_my_code`` in their name.
